# 🧠 MetricMentor – Your Product Strategy Assistant

MetricMentor is a beginner-friendly Python-based app designed to simulate product strategy thinking for aspiring Product Analysts and Product Managers. This project was built as a final submission for **Code in Place 2025**, a global Python programming course by Stanford University.

## 📘 About the Project

MetricMentor is an interactive tool that helps users:

* Diagnose common product problems (e.g., churn, high CAC, low adoption)
* Learn key metrics like Retention, CAC, LTV, and Feature Adoption
* Simulate real-world product health scenarios
* Ask GPT-style follow-up questions (simulated)

It was built using beginner-level Python constructs, with two versions:

1. **Console Version** (`metricmentor_app.py`) – for command-line interaction
2. **Streamlit Version** (`metricmentor_streamlit.py`) – for a cleaner user interface
